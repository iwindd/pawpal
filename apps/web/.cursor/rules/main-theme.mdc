**Minimal & Clean**

- Avoid clutter, keep plenty of whitespace.
- Use simple layouts, grid-based sections, no unnecessary borders.
- Keep typography readable with 2–3 font sizes only.

**Cute & Playful (Cat Gamer vibes)**

- Add subtle “cat gamer” personality (icons, mascots, micro-illustrations).
- Rounded corners (xl/2xl), soft shadows, slightly playful micro-interactions.
- Use emoji or cute accent icons sparingly to keep premium feeling.

**Premium Look**

- Consistent spacing & alignment, balanced compositions.
- Smooth hover animations, transitions (ease-in-out, 200–300ms).
- Use gradients or glassmorphism sparingly to highlight premium elements.

**Color Scheme**

- Main theme colors already defined in Mantine: **pink + blue**.
- Pink: use for highlights, actions (primary buttons, key CTAs).
- Blue: use for secondary accents, links, or hover states.
- Background: light, airy, avoid heavy saturation.
- Keep contrast high enough for accessibility.

**UX / UI**

- Components must be intuitive: clear buttons, readable inputs, large enough tap areas.
- Navigation simple and shallow (2 levels max).
- Responsive design: mobile-first, smooth scaling for desktop.

**Micro UX**

- Add small, cute touches (loading cat paw spinner, hover glow, etc.).
- Keep them lightweight, not distracting.

**Do / Don’t**

- ✅ Do: minimal layouts, playful but elegant elements, premium feel.
- ❌ Don’t: overcrowd with too many icons, heavy neon gamer styles, or overly childish looks.
